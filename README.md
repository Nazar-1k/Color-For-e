Out of a large number of colors, we consider our favorite colors to be more pleasing to the eye and to some extent "tastier" than others. Remembering us in childhood, when it came to choosing food, of course we chose our favorite shade. M&M's are popular chocolates produced by Mars LLC. Our device will sort this chocolate dragee so that you can enjoy the taste of the "tastiest color" (red, blue, green, orange, yellow, or brown).



The goal of our project is to build a sorting device based on the interaction of the Arduino hardware and computing platform, the TCS230 color sensor, two MG995 Tower Pro servo motors using the Arduino IDE environment using C++/C functions.
